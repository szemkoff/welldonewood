    end

    Platforms --> Analytics[Native Analytics]

```

#### Free Tools Setup

1. **Google Sheets as Central Hub** (Free)
   - Create a content calendar spreadsheet with tabs for:
     - Editorial calendar (dates, platforms, topics)
     - Content ideas and brainstorming
     - Performance tracking
     - URL shortening tracking
   - Share with team members for collaborative planning
   - Template link: [bit.ly/social-template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/create) (placeholder)

2. **Buffer Free Plan** (Free - 3 accounts, 10 scheduled posts)
   - Connect Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest accounts
   - Schedule core promotional content
   - Use for most important announcements and product features
   - Best for planned, strategic content

3. **Facebook Business Suite** (Free)
   - Manage both Facebook and Instagram posts, stories, and messaging
   - Schedule content specific to these platforms
   - Respond to comments and messages
   - View basic analytics

4. **IFTTT Automation** (Free)
   - Create applets to cross-post between platforms
   - Example applets:
     - "When a new blog post is published, share to Facebook"
     - "When a photo is posted to Instagram, save to Pinterest board"
     - "When a product is added to the website, draft a social post"

#### Workflow Process

1. **Planning Stage** (Google Sheets)
   - Plan monthly content themes and weekly topics
   - Assign content creation responsibilities
   - Track important dates, promotions, and seasonal content

2. **Content Creation**
   - Create text, images, and videos based on the content calendar
   - Store in shared Google Drive folder organized by platform/date
   - Use Canva Free for graphic design if needed

3. **Scheduling** (Mixed approach)
   - High-priority content: Schedule via Buffer (10 posts limit)
   - Facebook/Instagram content: Schedule via Facebook Business Suite
   - Pinterest content: Schedule directly or use Buffer remaining slots
   - Automation: Set up IFTTT applets for cross-posting and repetitive tasks

4. **Engagement & Monitoring**
   - Create a daily 15-minute check-in schedule to respond to comments
   - Divide platform monitoring responsibilities among team members
   - Use native platform notifications for timely responses

5. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Collect data from native platform analytics monthly
   - Record key metrics in the Google Sheets performance tab
   - Adjust strategy based on performance data

#### Limitations and Considerations

- **Buffer Free Plan**: Limited to 10 scheduled posts per profile, requiring manual scheduling for additional content
- **Manual Coordination**: More manual effort required compared to paid solutions
- **Limited Analytics**: Basic metrics available; advanced reporting requires manual compilation
- **Time Investment**: Requires disciplined time management for daily platform checks and engagement
- **Scaling Challenges**: As social presence grows, may need to eventually upgrade to paid solutions

2. **Content Adaptation**: Content is adapted for each social media platform's format
3. **Scheduled Publishing**: Posts are scheduled using a social media management tool
4. **Cross-Promotion**: Content is cross-promoted across platforms
5. **Engagement Monitoring**: Responses and engagement are monitored and managed
6. **Analytics Tracking**: Performance is measured with platform-specific analytics
