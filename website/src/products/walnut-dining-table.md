## Craftsmanship Meets Function

This dining table represents the pinnacle of traditional woodworking craftsmanship. Each table is handcrafted from solid walnut, carefully selected for grain pattern and character. The tabletop is constructed using traditional breadboard ends, which allow for seasonal wood movement while maintaining a clean, elegant appearance.

## Features

- Solid black walnut construction
- Traditional mortise and tenon joinery
- Hand-rubbed oil finish for a smooth, natural feel
- Breadboard ends to prevent warping
- Tapered legs with subtle detailing
- Optional expansion leaves available

## Care Instructions

To maintain the beauty of your walnut dining table, dust regularly with a soft cloth. Clean with a damp cloth and mild soap as needed, then dry thoroughly. Apply furniture wax or oil every 6-12 months to maintain the finish and protect the wood.

Avoid placing hot items directly on the wood surface, and use coasters under drinks to prevent water rings. With proper care, this table will become a cherished heirloom for generations.
