Hello from Well Done Wood
===============================================

Hi there,

I wanted to personally reach out about some exciting updates to our wood product line that I think might interest you. As spring approaches, I've been thinking about how our products can help transform both indoor and outdoor spaces.

OUTDOOR LIVING: DECKING SEASON HAS ARRIVED
-------------------------------------------
With warmer days ahead, I'm particularly excited about our premium Ash decking. Many of our customers have been asking when they should start their outdoor projects, and now is the perfect time. Our Ash decking comes in both light and dark finishes, and I've been amazed by how it holds up against the elements while still maintaining its natural beauty.

What makes our Ash decking special:
* 15/16" thickness provides substantial feel and longevity
* Available in 6' or 8' lengths for flexible installation
* Both light and dark finishes available to match your style
* Designed for comfort underfoot – stays cooler than composite options

One of our recent customers in Florida mentioned how their deck "transformed their entire backyard experience" – that kind of feedback makes my day.

INTERIOR & EXTERIOR SIDING OPTIONS
----------------------------------
Our siding collection has been my personal focus lately. Whether you're working on interior accent walls or exterior projects, I've made sure we have options that combine both beauty and durability:

* Nickel Gap Ash - I love how the subtle shadow gap creates a clean, contemporary look that works in both modern and traditional spaces.
* V-joint/Nickel Gap Poplar - Available in both light and dark finishes, this has been a favorite for interior walls.
* Triple Shadow Fluted Siding - If you're looking for something with more dimension, this creates beautiful shadow lines that add character.
* Grooved Siding in Hickory/Acacia - The natural variation in these woods creates a truly unique look.

Just a reminder for our professional partners - we offer 15% off retail pricing, and we've streamlined our ordering process to make your projects even easier.

WALL PANELS: ADDING WARMTH & CHARACTER
--------------------------------------
I've also been working on expanding our wall panel options. These are perfect for adding warmth and texture to interior spaces - something I noticed many homes are looking for these days.

Two highlights from our panel collection:
* "Clouds" Wall Planks - These Hickory/Acacia planks create a serene atmosphere that I've seen work beautifully in bedrooms and living spaces.
* "Mushroom Wood" Wall Planks - Available in Gold, Black, White, and Gray finishes, these pine planks add incredible character to accent walls.

I installed the Mushroom Wood in White in my own office last month, and it's completely transformed the space.

If you're working on a project, I'd be happy to help with recommendations. We can work with your specific needs and budget - just reach out directly.

Our current pricing structure includes:
- Drop-ship pricing for direct deliveries
- FREE DELIVERY on orders over $3,000
- Special contractor and builder pricing

All the best,
Stan
